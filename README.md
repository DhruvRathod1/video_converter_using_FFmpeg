##When to Use Each Method

Knowing when to use each process management method is critical for efficient process management in Node.js. Here are some general guidelines:

->Use exec when you need to execute a command in a shell environment and capture the output and error streams of the child process.

->Use fork when you need to create a new Node.js process that shares some or all of the parent processâ€™s memory and runtime environment, and when you need to communicate between the parent and child processes using IPC.

->Use spawn when you need to spawn a new process and stream its output and error streams back to the parent process.
